#The quantum circuit mapping approach is an indispensable part of the software stack for the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) device.
#It has a significant impact on the reliability of computational tasks on NISQ devices. To improve the overall fidelity of physical circuits, we propose a quantum circuit mapping method based on multi-agent cooperation. 
#This approach considers the Spatio-temporal variation of quantum operation quality on the NISQ device when inserting ancillary operations. 
#It consists of two core components: the qubit placement algorithm and the qubit routing method. The qubit placement algorithm exploits the iterated local search framework to find a desirable initial mapping for the reduced symmetric form of the original circuit. 
#The qubit routing method generates the physical circuit through multi-agent communication and collaboration. Each agent inserts the ancillary gates independently according to its environment state. 
#The quality of the physical circuit evolves according to an information-exchanging mechanism between agents, which combines the local search and global search.
